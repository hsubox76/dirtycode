## Overview

The first thing we want to do is show you that you can type some code and
immediately make a change to this lesson webpage you're reading.  Later we'll
get to why this works.  First priority is to show you that you can start
doing things without setting anything up.

You'll need:

- Chrome
- To be looking at this webpage in Chrome

(Other browsers have devtools too, but the instructions will be a bit different.
Feel free to try them out if you think you can translate these steps to what
you'd do in Firefox or something.)

## Lesson

To open Chrome Developer Tools (devtools), the keyboard shortcut is:
- on Mac: `cmd-option-j`
- on Windows/Linux: `ctrl-shift-j`

Or through the top-right menu:

![How to open devtools](/assets/images/devtools_menu.png)

This should open up a box that takes up either the bottom half or the right
half of your browser and has tabs "Elements", "Console", etc.

On the bottom:

![Devtools on bottom](/assets/images/console_bottom.png)

On the right:

![Devtools on right](/assets/images/console_right.png)

If you don't like where it is, you can move it by opening up the 3-dots
menu (not the Chrome 3-dots menu, it's right below it if your devtools
has opened on the right), and picking a new option for **Dock side**

![Dock menu](/assets/images/move_dock.png)

Make sure you're in the **Console** tab.

![The console tab selected](/assets/images/console_tab.png)

There is a prompt in the console tab where you can type code, and hit enter,
and it will try and run the code, and in the next line it will tell you the
results.  Here's something you can try:

![document.getElementById("pizzabox")](/assets/images/console_command.png)

`document.getElementById("pizzabox")` means "find the element on this page
with an id of **pizzabox**", and the second line means it found it and that's
what that element's html looks like. As for what it looks like to you, the
human looking at this webpage, it looks like this:

<div id="pizzabox" class="sandbox-element">pizza</div>

Because that's the exact thing it found, that red box with the word "pizza"
in it.  Let's change it.  Type this in the console and hit enter (copy and
paste if you want):

```document.getElementById("pizzabox").innerText = "cat"```

The word **pizza** in that box should have changed to the word **cat**.

If it upsets you that you have been forced to put a cat in a pizza box, try
refreshing the page and it will go back to **pizza**.  That's because you
have not in fact hacked the website, you only changed what you see in your
own browser.
