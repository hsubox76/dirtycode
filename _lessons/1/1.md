## Overview

The first thing we want to do is show you that you can type some code and
immediately vandalize this actual lesson webpage you're reading.  Later we'll
get to why this works.  First priority is to show you that you can start
making the code do real things without setting anything up.

You'll need:

- Chrome
- To be looking at this webpage in Chrome

(Other browsers have devtools too, but the instructions will be a bit different.
Feel free to try them out if you think you can translate these steps to what
you'd do in Firefox or something.)

## What To Do

### Open The Console

To write code, you need a place to type it, a place that will do the things
you typed.  The easiest place for the average person to do this is the
developer tools panel in your own browser.  Chrome is a pretty popular browser
and has a very nice set of dev tools, so we'll use those.

To open Chrome Developer Tools (devtools), the keyboard shortcut is:
- on Mac: `cmd-option-j`
- on Windows/Linux: `ctrl-shift-j`

Or through the top-right menu:

![How to open devtools](assets/images/devtools_menu.png)

This should open up a box that takes up either the bottom half or the right
half of your browser and has tabs "Elements", "Console", etc.

On the bottom:

![Devtools on bottom](assets/images/console_bottom.png)

On the right:

![Devtools on right](assets/images/console_right.png)

If you don't like where it is, you can move it by opening up the 3-dots
menu (not the Chrome 3-dots menu, it's right below it if your devtools
has opened on the right), and picking a new option for **Dock side**

### Vandalize This Page

Make sure you're in the **Console** tab.

![The console tab selected](assets/images/console_tab.png)

There is a prompt in the console tab where you can type code, and hit enter,
and it will try and run the code, and in the next line it will tell you the
results.  Here's something you can try:

![document.getElementById("pizzabox")](assets/images/console_command.png)

`document.getElementById("pizzabox")` means "find the element on this page
with an id of **pizzabox**", and the second line means it found it and that's
what that element's html looks like. As for what it looks like to you, the
human looking at this webpage, it looks like this:

<div id="pizzabox" class="sandbox-element">pizza</div>

Because that's the exact thing it found, that red box with the word "pizza"
in it.  Let's change it.  Type this in the console and hit enter (copy and
paste if you want):

```document.getElementById("pizzabox").innerText = "cat"```

The word **pizza** in that box should have changed to the word **cat**.

If it upsets you that you have been forced to put a cat in a pizza box, try
refreshing the page and it will go back to **pizza**.  That's because you
have not in fact hacked the website, you only changed what you see in your
own browser.

Replace the word "cat" with any words you like (make sure to leave the
quotes there) and you can put whatever you want in the box.

## What Just Happened

If you're familiar with html, you may know that everything represented on a
webpage is described with little bracketed tags around text like
`<p>hello</p>` and such.  Everything in a tag is an **element**.

And there are some ways to find the one you want.  Go back down to the console.
Next to the **Console** tab there should be an **Elements** tab.  Click on
it.

![Elements tab](assets/images/elements_tab.png)

You should see a bunch of html under it that basically shows everything on
this page.  Find the icon all the way to the left of the Elements tab.  This
is the element selector.  If you click on it, it turns blue, that means it's
on.

![Element selector](assets/images/element_selector.png)

It'll turn off if you click on it again, or click an element.  Let's
click an element, namely the pizza box.  With the element selector on (blue),
scroll up to the pizza box if you have to, and hover over it.  It should get
highlighted blue and have a tooltip maybe.

![Selecting the pizza element](assets/images/selecting_element.png)

When you click on it, the highlight will go away, but now you should see a
line of text highlighted in the html below.

![Element selected in html](assets/images/element_in_html.png)

That line, `<div id="pizzabox" class="sandbox-element">pizza</div>` represents
the box that you've been tampering with.  If you notice the `id="pizzabox"`
part, that's where I gave it a unique name when I created it - "pizzabox" -
which makes it easy to refer to.

So let's take this apart:

```document.getElementById("pizzabox").innerText = "cat"```

- **document** is a handle that refers to the whole html document that
represents what's displayed on a webpage.  What comes after the dot is either
going to be a **method** (something the document can do) or a **property**
(something the document has).

- **getElementById** is what comes after the dot in this case, and it's a
method.  You can tell if something is a method because it is followed by
parentheses that might or might not have something in them.  So
**getElementById** is something a **document** can do.

- The parentheses do have something in them in this case, which is "pizzabox".
When methods have something in the parentheses, that means whatever you want
it to do, you want it to do with that thing.  The things in the parentheses
are called **arguments** or **parameters**.

- If you remember, "pizzabox" is the name I gave the red box with the word
"pizza" in it.  So **getElementById** finds the element with an id of
"pizzabox".  So the part up to here `document.getElementById("pizzabox")`
is basically now referring that box and waiting to be told what to do about it.

- The next dot again, means we're looking at a method or property.  In this
case it's a property (no parentheses) called **innerText** which is basically,
the words inside this element.

- So you take all that, "hey document, find the element inside you with an id
of *pizzabox* and find that element's innerText" and add `= "cat"` which means
"now set that to *cat*".

- When you see the single equals sign "=", it's not checking if something is
equal, it's an order to make it equal that.  So whatever the innerText used
to be, forget it, make it "cat" now.
