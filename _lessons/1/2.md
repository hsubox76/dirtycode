description: Tamper with a REAL webpage (Twitter)

## Overview

You might be thinking, "Okay, if I type a special command I can mess with
a special area of the page you set up, big deal."

So let's try a real website.  Well, Twitter.

## What To Do

In a new tab, open [Twitter Dot Com](http://twitter.com).

In that tab, open the console.  Remember:

- on Mac: `cmd-option-j`
- on Windows/Linux: `ctrl-shift-j`

And it looks like this:

And it's the Console tab:

The one in the new Twitter tab does not know anything about the one you opened
previously in this tab.  It is in its own little world.

Anyway, make sure you're in a screen where you can see some tweets, like so:

Type this into the console (or copy and paste it) and hit enter:

```
for (let tweet of document.getElementsByClassName("tweet-text")) { tweet.innerText = "buh" }
```

This should change the text of all tweets on the page to simply "buh".
Haha, now everybody looks stupid!

Now try this:

```
for (let name of document.getElementsByClassName("fullname")) { name.innerText = "boof" }
```

Now everyone is named boof!  Ha ha!  Good times.

If that didn't work, like maybe you're on the new mobile version of the Twitter
website, which labels its tweet text elements differently, try the nuclear
option:

```
for (let tweet of document.getElementsByTagName("SPAN")) { tweet.innerText = "buh" }
```

On most websites, this changes every scrap of text on the page to "buh".  Let chaos
reign.

Again, this changes nothing for anyone else, just you, but this is a great way
to take a fraudulent screenshot.  Side note: never do anything drastic based
on a Twitter screenshot as the only evidence.

## What Just Happened

This isn't much different than the previous lesson, except you're changing
a bunch of elements at once, because of the magic of programming.

Previously, we typed:

```
document.getElementById("pizzabox")
```

Which only gets one element, because *ids* are unique.  Only one element on
the page can have the *id* of "pizzabox".  We found it, and we changed it.

This time, our first try used something kind of similar to `getElementById`
but also kind of not.  In the middle of the first thing we typed was:

```
document.getElementsByClassName("tweet-text")
```

There can only be one element on a page with any given *id*, but a bunch of
elements can have the same *class name*.  Namely, every snippet of Tweet
text has the class name "tweet-text."

This "for" line (we call the whole thing a for-loop) is a way to get all of
those things, and do something to each
of them.  Basically a for-loop says:

```
for (a way to go through a list of things one-by-one) { do this to each thing }
```

And what we're doing to each thing (each tweet text) is making its
innerText equal "buh".

So `document.getElementsByClassName("tweet-text")` gets everything with a
*class name* of "tweet-text," which is the actual tweets, and
`document.getElementsByClassName("fullname")` gets everything with a *class name*
of "fullname," which is people's display names.

When you look at the html, you can find the *class name* in the same place as
the *id* we saw earlier.  If you remember the pizzabox element, its html looked like
this:

![Element selected in html](assets/images/element_in_html.png)

I noted that the *id* was set up there by putting `id="pizzabox` in the html, and now
you might also notice `class="sandbox-element"`.  That gives it the *class name*
"sandbox-element".

The third selector, that ruined the whole page,
`document.getElementsByTagName("SPAN")`, gets an even broader set of things.
The *tag name* is the type of html tag it is, like `<p>` or `<div>`, which is
the vaguest possible way to refer to an element.  Like `<p>` or `<div>`.
`<span>`s are usually used for the smallest units of text content, and are
surrounded with other elements meant to get them in the right place and make
them look pretty.

I'm not going to explain exactly how to write your own for-loop yet.  The point
is to give you an idea of "why programming?"  Even if you're familiar with
screwing around with one piece of webpage text as a one off, it would be
tedious to change every bit of text.

If you give the computer an instruction and a list of things to do it on, you
can ruin an entire page humorously (or not, depending on your opinion of
childish nonsense vandalism) in the blink of an eye.

If you're frustrated that none of these hilarious edits are going beyond your
own browser for other people to enjoy, and feel like this is a fruitless
exercise, note that this is basically how browser extensions work.  If you
ever downloaded a Chrome extension to block ads or change a disliked public
figure's name to "Fartface" when it appears, all it is, is code like this,
messing with whatever webpage you happen to visit and changing what you see
locally in the browser.

Screwing with your own view of webpages in the browser is very much a real
life skill as is.
