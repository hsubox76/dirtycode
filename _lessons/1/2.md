description: Tamper with a REAL webpage (Twitter)

## Overview

You might be thinking, "Okay, if I type a special command I can mess with
a special area of the page you set up, big deal."

So let's try a real website.  Well, Twitter.

## What To Do

In a new tab, open [Twitter Dot Com](http://twitter.com).

In that tab, open the console.  Remember:

- on Mac: `cmd-option-j`
- on Windows/Linux: `ctrl-shift-j`

And it looks like this:

And it's the Console tab:

The one in the new Twitter tab does not know anything about the one you opened
previously in this tab.  It is in its own little world.

Anyway, make sure you're in a screen where you can see some tweets.  Type
this into the console and hit enter:

```
for (let tweet of document.getElementsByClassName("tweet-text")) { tweet.innerText = "buh" }
```

This should change the text of all tweets on the page to simply "buh".
Haha, now everybody looks stupid!  Now try this:

```
for (let name of document.getElementsByClassName("fullname")) { name.innerText = "boof" }
```

Now everyone is named boof!  Ha ha!  Good times.
